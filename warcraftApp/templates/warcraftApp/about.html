        <h2 class="alt-heading">Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            World of Warcraft, known by players as WoW, is a Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game
            (MMORPG for short). It takes place in the fantasy world of Azeroth, which is inhabited by thousands of
            different non-playable denizens, known as NPCs, as well as millions of other real-life players, known as
            PCs. The goal for players in WoW is to level up and progress their character by exploring the world of
            Azeroth, completing quests, and engaging in PvP and PvE combat.
        </p>

        <h2>Getting Started: Character Race</h2>
        <p>
            If you’re looking to get started in WoW, you’ll first need to create a character. Character creation brings
            up a central theme of the game, which is the opposing factions of the Alliance and Horde. Players that
            prefer ideals of justice, faith, and nobility may decide to play a character from the Alliance. Those
            characters include Humans, Dwarfs, Night Elfs, Gnomes, Draenei, Worgen, and Pandaren.
        </p>

            On the other hand, players that value strength and honor might look to the Horde. Characters belonging
            to the horde faction include Orcs, Undead, Tauren, Trolls, Blood Elfs, Goblins, and Pandaren.

        <h2>Getting Started: Classes</h2>
        <p>
            A class in World of Warcraft refers to how your character will adventure and deal damage. There are
            melee or close combat classes as well as ranged damage classes. Some classes use magic, other’s use
            swords or bows, and some prefer shapeshifting. The class options apply to both Alliance and Horde
            factions and include monk, death knight, demon hunter, druid, paladin, shaman, warlock, mage, priest,
            warrior, rogue, and hunter.
